As a dedicated 3rd Year AI undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, I am deeply passionate about the convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. My academic journey, highlighted by top scores in Combined Mathematics, Physics, and ICT, has equipped me with a strong analytical foundation.

Currently, I am gaining hands-on experience as a Quantum Machine Learning Research Intern at Qneuron, where I contribute to cutting-edge projects in this emerging field. My technical expertise is further demonstrated through my active participation on platforms like HackerRank, GitHub, and Medium, where I continuously refine my skills and share my knowledge.

I am committed to driving innovation in technology and am eager to connect with like-minded professionals to explore new opportunities and collaborations.
